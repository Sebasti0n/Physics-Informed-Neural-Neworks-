# Physics-informed neural network

New approach to solving problems in computational phsyics using deep learning. Integrates the prijnciples of physics, often expressed in the form of differential equations, direcly into the architecture of neural Networks. 

### 1. Combining Physical Laws with Machine Learning: 
Traditional neural networks learn patterns and relationships from data. PINNs on the otherhand, are trained not just on data bt also on the underlying physical laws governing the topic being studied. This is done by incorporating the governign differential equations into the loss function of the neural network. 

### 2. Structure of a PINN
